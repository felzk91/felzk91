Thanks for dropping by my Github page. My name is Felix. I'm a data enthusiast who found his interest in analytics while working on marketing projects. Little did I know, this curiosity would evolve into a full-blown passion.

I've picked up a few technical skills during my 'data' journey -Python, R, SQL, Tableau. Along with my background in marketing and a knack for numbers, I'm dedicated to find solutions to any complex business problems.
